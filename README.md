## My Favourite Points in ["Good Developer Mindset"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-fundamentals-of-a-good-developer-mindset-in-15-minutes-81321ab8a682/)
#### My favorite Rules where
- Prioritizing and espesially the quote "The desirability of any change is directly proportional to the value of the change and inversely proportional to the effort involved in making the change."
- Stop Reinventing.
- Good enough is fine “Perfect is the enemy of good.”—Voltaire
- Self-Development : learning different programming languages and tools, reading books on software development.

Be open-minded. Don’t be obsessive about one technology.

one more thing i found very usefull is "Start small, improve it, then extend."
